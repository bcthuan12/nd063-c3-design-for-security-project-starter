Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

1. IAM policy is allowing full access to resources, not following the principle of least privilege
2. The use of a non-root account is not enforced
3. CloudTrail Trail is not specified
4. VPC Security Groups allow all ingress and egress traffic which violates the AWS recommendation
5. TCP port 5000 is reachable from the internet on the EC2 instance
6. Server-side encryption and logging is not enabled for S3 buckets

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

1. Set IAM policies for not allowing root user and to enforce MFA, as well as the specific permissions
2. Create a CloudTrail that is stored on S3
3. Limit the traffic on the Security Groups only allow 80 and 443 as well as reference the other security group for accessing AWS resource within VPC
4. Disable all other non-necessary ports on the EC2 instance
5. Enable S3 server-side encryption and logging
